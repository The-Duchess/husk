>Project Description:

>Husk is a configurable irc bot using rirc [framework](https://github.com/The-Duchess/ruby-irc-framework)

>- it is configured via a ruby [script](https://github.com/The-Duchess/husk/blob/master/config.rb) file that sets variables for the irc bot

>- it is plugable using the plugin design and manager in rirc

>- it has a core set of [commands](https://github.com/The-Duchess/husk) to change state of the bot that can be reloaded during runtime for updates making it truly modular so it never has to restart.
